The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.\nChief executive John Walden, who said it had been \"another rather eventful period\" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.\nShares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.\nThe supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a \"world-leading\" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.\nRetail analyst Nick Bubb said: \"Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.\"\nSainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.\nHowever, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.\nAnalysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.", "correct_choice": "Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period.", "list_choices": ["Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over February.", "Argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the Christmas period."], "lbl": 1}
