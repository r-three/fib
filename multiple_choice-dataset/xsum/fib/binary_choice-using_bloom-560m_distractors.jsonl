These elements, such as carbon, sulphur, nitrogen and hydrogen, were added later on by space rocks after Earth's core had finished forming.\n\"Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the Solar System formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point,\" said Yuan Li, from the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\"The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet.\"\nThe group had previously published papers showing that if even if carbon had not vaporised into space when the planet was largely molten, it would have ended up in the metallic core of our planet - because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon.\nBut if this is the case, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?\nThe team used laboratory experiments that can recreate the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets.\nThe found that one scenario that could reconcile the discrepancies in the carbon-to-sulphur ratio and carbon abundance was an embryonic planet like Mercury colliding with and being absorbed by Earth, early in its history.\n\"Because it's a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth's mantle,\" said Dr Dasgupta.", "correct_choice": "Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision, a theory suggests.", "list_choices": ["...\n\n===\n\nWrite a summary of the text above :\nThe Earth may have been the source of carbon-rich material that helped build the planet's core, a study suggests.", "Much of Earth's life-giving carbon could have been delivered in a planetary collision, a theory suggests."], "lbl": 1}
