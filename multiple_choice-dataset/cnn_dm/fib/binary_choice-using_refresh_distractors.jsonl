'' on election day , nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president jonathan 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in lagos , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .", "correct_choice": "<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> Here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely-contested elections in the country 's history is so important . </t> <t> For the first time in Nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections . </t> <t> This is n't Buhari 's first time leading Nigeria -- but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years . </t>", "<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>"], "lbl": 1}
