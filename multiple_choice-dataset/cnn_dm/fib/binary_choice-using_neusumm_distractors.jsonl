( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' ) with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .", "correct_choice": "<t> five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded , we are only beginning to understand its effects on the gulf . </t> <t> a crab species may be a key indicator of the impact . </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded , we are only beginning to understand its effects on the gulf . </t> <t> a crab species may be a key indicator of the impact . </t>", "<t> -LRB- CNN -RRB- Five years after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . </t>  <t> The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . </t>  <t> It 's not just Gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . </t>"], "lbl": 0}

'' on election day , nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president jonathan 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in lagos , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .", "correct_choice": "<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> For the first time in Nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections . </t>  <t> Muhammadu Buhari , 72 , won Nigeria 's presidential election , defeating incumbent Goodluck Jonathan by about two million votes . </t>  <t> -LRB- CNN -RRB- The last time Muhammadu Buhari came to power in Nigeria , it was by force . </t>  <t> This time it was by the ballot box . </t>  <t> Here are five reasons why one of the most fiercely-contested elections in the country 's history is so important . </t>", "<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>"], "lbl": 1}
