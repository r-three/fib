'' the researchers tested their thesis by showing 82 college students 40 photographs -- some of highly pleasant images , such as children with kittens , and some of highly unpleasant images , such as children who were malnourished . half of the participants in the study were given `` an acute dose '' of acetaminophen -- 1,000 milligrams -- and the other half were given a placebo with the same appearance . the subjects were then asked to rate the photos according to how unpleasant or pleasant they were . those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo . `` in other words , positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively , '' the authors reported . the researchers followed up by testing a group of 85 people to see whether this change in judgment applied just to emotions or whether the drug blunted people 's evaluation of magnitude in general . this group showed the same blunting of emotional reactions . but acetaminophen did not affect how much blue they saw in each photo . but people who participated in the study did not appear to know they were acting differently , said baldwin way , an assistant professor of psychology who was another of the study 's authors . `` most people probably are n't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen , '' way said . each week , about 23 % of american adults -- or 52 million people -- use a medicine containing acetaminophen , according to the nonprofit consumer healthcare products association . the authors said it was not known whether other pain relievers , such as ibuprofen and aspirin , have the same effect . but have no fear -- they plan to study that question , as well .", "correct_choice": "<t> subjects taking acetaminophen reacted less strongly to both pleasant and unpleasant photos . </t> <t> each week , 52 million americans use the pain reliever . </t> <t> unknown whether other pain products produce the same effect . </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> the authors of the study , which was published this week in psychological science , say that it was already known that acetaminophen blunted psychological pain . </t>  <t> those who took the acetaminophen rated all the photos less extremely than those who took the placebo . </t>  <t> `` in other words , positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively , '' the authors reported . </t>  <t> `` most people probably are n't aware of how their emotions may be impacted when they take acetaminophen , '' way said . </t>", "<t> subjects taking acetaminophen reacted less strongly to both pleasant and unpleasant photos . </t> <t> each week , 52 million americans use the pain reliever . </t> <t> unknown whether other pain products produce the same effect . </t>"], "lbl": 1}

( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species .

'' apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and brontosaurus had five , according to the museum 's website , so marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names . later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age : as the animal gets older , two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum . paleontologist elmer riggs concluded in 1903 that the brontosaurus was really a young apatosaurus , and therefore must go by that name , according to the museum . emanuel tschopp , a paleontologist at the nova university of lisbon , portugal , led this latest study , which took five years and included visits to 20 museums in europe and the united states to collect data . by examining `` 500 anatomical traits , '' tschopp said he was able to `` reconstruct the family tree '' of diplodocids -- the family apatosaurus and brontosaurus belong to . tschopp `` looked at every single specimen , '' according to jacques gauthier , curator of vertebrate paleontology at yale peabody museum and `` noted their characteristics , '' plugging data into an algorithm that revealed `` five species in the group of diplodocids . '' two of them are brontosaurus-like and three are apatosaurus-like , gauthier said . while his findings have earned the excitement of brontosaurus fans everywhere , tschopp said he is `` expecting a debate about the case of brontosaurus . '' `` we think we have good evidence , '' he said , `` but i know there are other research groups that do not completely agree . '' for gauthier , tschopp 's discovery means changes are coming to the original brontosaurus skeleton that has lived at the yale peabody museum of natural history since 1936 . `` we 're definitely going to have to change the label , '' he said .", "correct_choice": "<t> scientist : fossils once renamed should again be classified as brontosaurus . </t> <t> study took five years and involved visits to 20 museums. </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> scientist : fossils once renamed should again be classified as brontosaurus . </t> <t> study took five years and involved visits to 20 museums. </t>", "<t> o.c. </t>  <t> marsh first named the brontosaurus in 1879 , after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at como bluff , wyoming , according to the yale peabody museum of natural history . </t>  <t> by examining `` 500 anatomical traits , '' tschopp said he was able to `` reconstruct the family tree '' of diplodocids -- the family apatosaurus and brontosaurus belong to . </t>  <t> two of them are brontosaurus-like and three are apatosaurus-like , gauthier said . </t>"], "lbl": 0}
