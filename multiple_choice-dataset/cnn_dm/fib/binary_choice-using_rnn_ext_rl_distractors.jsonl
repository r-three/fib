'' in fairness , schuyler is n't your typical 124-pound person . the nebraska native , 35 , is a professional on the competitive-eating circuit and once gobbled 363 chicken wings in 30 minutes . wearing shades and a black hoodie , schuyler beat four other teams on sunday , including pairs of football players and pro wrestlers and two married competitive eaters . she also broke her own big texan record of two 72-ounce steaks and sides , set last year , when she bested previous record-holder joey `` jaws '' chestnut . the landmark big texan restaurant offers its `` 72-ounce challenge '' daily to anyone who can eat the massive steak , plus fixings , in under an hour . those who ca n't do so must pay $ 72 for the meal . schuyler , who now lives in sacramento , california , won $ 5,000 for her efforts . her feat will be submitted to guinness world records . but mostly , she just seemed pleased to enjoy a hearty meal on the house . `` it 's free , so i 'm pretty happy about that , '' she told kvii . `` otherwise it would have cost me about 300 bucks .

'' clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama . o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate , '' the democratic party is full of `` good leaders . '' `` history is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of iowa , '' o'malley said . in some polls , he has scored in the low single digits in the state . in a march cnn/orc poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked o'malley . in a january poll by bloomberg politics and the des moines register , o'malley was also at 1 % among iowa democrats . clinton , who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points , is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told cnn on friday . while he would n't say much about clinton , when asked about her candidacy , o'malley said , `` if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run . and they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . '' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary .
