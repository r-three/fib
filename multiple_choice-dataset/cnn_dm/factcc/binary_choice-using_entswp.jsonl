( bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species .

'' on election day , nigerians queued for hours in hot weather to cast their vote . some of the biometric reader machines malfunctioned -- including the one at president jonathan 's polling station -- and voting had to be extended into the following day . but the technical issues did n't keep people from voting -- and in lagos , some voters cast their ballots with the aid of the light from their mobile phones . and even though some card readers did n't work in some places , many say they helped to cut down on vote rigging . boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy , crime and generating enough power to light up the country are other major issues . the pressure will soon be on buhari to deliver and there will be no excuses . if he fails , nigerians will be waiting for him at the polls just four short years from now .", "correct_choice": "<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>", "list_choices": ["<t> muhammadu buhari 's win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>", "<t> boko haram win marks the first democratic transition of power from a ruling party to the opposition . </t> <t> nigeria , the most populous country in africa , is grappling with violent boko haram extremists . </t>"], "lbl": 0}
